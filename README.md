# narada
Narada is a fully local CLI tool that transcribes audio from any video-call platform (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, Discord, etc.) by capturing audio from the user’s selected OS audio devices. It writes near-real-time transcripts to a user-chosen text file and optionally serves a LAN-only live view (URL + QR code) for any device on the same Wi-Fi.
